# Wireless-sensor-network-using-STM32
This project demonstrates how to monitor sensor data wirelessly using an NRF24L01-based STM32 Sensor Node and an ESP32 Wi-Fi Gateway. The system collects environmental data from the sensor node and uploads it to the ThingSpeak Cloud Server for real-time monitoring.
